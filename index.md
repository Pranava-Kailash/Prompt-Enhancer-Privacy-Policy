# Privacy Policy for Prompt Enhancer

**Last Updated: November 10, 2025**

## Introduction

This privacy policy explains how the Prompt Enhancer Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles user information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or user data.**

Specifically, the Extension does NOT collect:

- Personally identifiable information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Browsing history or web activity
- Website content or user-generated content
- Personal communications
- Authentication credentials
- Financial information
- Health information
- Location data
- Any other personal or sensitive user data

## How the Extension Works

The Extension operates entirely on your local device using Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI model. When you click the "Enhance" button:

1. Your prompt text is read from the ChatGPT input field on your device
2. The text is processed locally by Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano)
3. The enhanced prompt is displayed to you in a modal window
4. **No data leaves your browser or device at any point**

## Permissions Explained

The Extension requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **storage**: Used only to store the AI model status (e.g., "ready", "downloading") locally on your device. No user prompts or personal data are stored.
- **activeTab**: Allows the Extension to interact with the currently open ChatGPT tab to display the enhance button and modal.
- **scripting**: Required to inject the user interface elements (button and modal) into ChatGPT pages.
- **alarms**: Used to keep the background service worker responsive for processing enhancement requests. No tracking or analytics.
- **host_permissions** (chatgpt.com, chat.openai.com): Restricts the Extension to work only on ChatGPT domains. The Extension cannot access any other websites.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not use any third-party services, APIs, or analytics tools. All functionality is provided through:

- Chrome's native extension APIs
- Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI (which runs entirely on your device)

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, transfer, or disclose any user data to third parties** because we do not collect any user data in the first place.

## Data Retention

Since no user data is collected, stored, or transmitted, there is no data retention.

## Compliance with Chrome Web Store User Data Policy

The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Chrome Web Store User Data Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program_policies/#userdata), including the Limited Use requirements.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect data from children under 13 years of age. Since no data is collected from any users, this policy applies equally to all age groups.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
